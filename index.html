    <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
    <p>As a part of artificial intelligence, machine learning is an algorithm based on training data. It makes predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. It gradually increases its accuracy.</p>
    <table cellspacing="5" class="ML types">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><h4>1. Supervised Learning</h4></td>
            </tr>

                <td>It utilizes the historical input and output data in ML algorithms.
                    The outcomes I provided the machine are labeled data. The rest of the information is input features. Feeds algorithm data to the machine. Commonly used during supervised learning such as neural networks, decision trees, linear regression, and support vector machines.

                <td>The unsupervided learning is used when figuring out the patterns and getting the data from the pattern. Hidden Markov models, k-means, hierarchical clustering, and Gaussian mixture models are the common algorithms of the unsupervised learning.</td>

                <td>Reinforcement Learning is a ML technique that enables an agent to interact environment with trial and error. It learns from mistakes. It uses rewards and punishments as signals for positive and negative behavior. Temporal difference, deep adversarial networks, and Q-learning are the common algorithms of the reinforcement learning.</td>

    <h3>Deep Learning</h3>
    <p>Deep learning networks consist of many layers of neural networks that can analyze vast amounts of data and assign varying levels of significance to the connections within the network. It can be utilized in various applications such as autonomous vehicles, chatbots, and medical diagnoses.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Natural Language Processing</h3>
    <p>Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of ML focused on teaching computers to comprehend human speech and writing, rather than relying on traditional programming techniques that use numerical data. Machines can identify and comprehend language, generate new text, and interact with humans through digital assistants.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Neural Networks</h3>
    <p>Neural networks are a particular type of ML algorithm that is widely used. The design of networks is similar to the structure of the human brain, which consists of thousands or millions of interconnected processing nodes arranged into layers. Each cell and node receives inputs and generates an output. Then, this output is transmitted to other neurons. Also, each node performs a unique function.</p>
